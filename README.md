1.   The Landscape of Our Customers

Once upon a time, in the bustling world of CRM Bank, we had a diverse customer base of 10,000 individuals. 
These customers hailed from different corners of Europe, predominantly from France, Germany, and Spain. As we looked closer, we found that nearly half of our customers (49.14%) came from France, with the rest split almost equally between Germany and Spain.




2.The Tale of Exits and Retention


 In our quest to understand our customers better, we discovered an important pattern. Out of our 10,000 customers,
2,037 had exited the bank. A closer look revealed a significant gender disparity in these numbers. Female customers were more likely
to leave, with 1,139 exits compared to 898 male exits. This was a startling revelation for us, as it showed a churn rate of 25% for females versus 16% for males.






Chapter 3: The Journey Over Time

Our customer base has had its ups and downs over the years. The peak of customer exits occurred in August 2017,
when 143 customers left us. The data showed a rollercoaster of exits, with significant fluctuations over the years, 
reminding us of the ever-changing dynamics of our customer relationships.


Chapter 4: Balances and Products

We delved deeper into the financial lives of our customers and noticed a fascinating trend. Customers who held fewer products with us tended to have higher balances. This was an intriguing discovery, suggesting that our high-value customers might prefer simplicity or focused investments.





Chapter 5: Salaries and Scores

Our analysis revealed that customers with higher credit scores (between 600 and 700) enjoyed higher estimated salaries. It seemed that financial stability and creditworthiness often went hand in hand. Moreover, the balance and exit patterns remained consistent across different salary ranges, indicating a steady financial behavior among our customers.

Chapter 6: Age and Tenure





Age-wise, the majority of our customers fell into the 30-50 years bracket, making up 69.64% of our base. This age group showed a balanced mix of tenure, indicating that our customers in this age range stayed with us for varying lengths of time, from newcomers to long-term patrons.





Chapter 7: The Battle of Retention

In the grand scheme of things, we found solace in the fact that our efforts to retain customers bore fruit. With 8,000 retained customers compared to 2,000 who exited, the scales tipped heavily in favor of retention. This was a testament to our ongoing efforts to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.










4. After that, the count of transactions fluctuates but eventually stabilizes at 30904 transactions at 34 hours.
